= Getting Started

This document walks you through the development and deployment of a Node.js application to an OpenShift cluster using `odo`. It guides you on how to push new changes to your application and on other useful features of `odo`.

== Developing and deploying an application to an OpenShift cluster
To develop and deploy a Node.js application to an OpenShift cluster using `odo`:

. link:/docs/installation.md[Install the `odo` binary].
. Log into an OpenShift cluster:

* If you lack a local development cluster, we recommend using link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/minishift/getting-started/installing.html[Minishift] to deploy a development OpenShift cluster.
+
.. Run Minishift:
+
----
$ minishift start
----
.. Log into the OpenShift cluster:
+
----
$ odo login -u developer -p developer
----
+
[NOTE]
====
In order to make full use of `odo` functionality, it is recommended to enable the OpenShift link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/architecture/service_catalog/index.html[service catalog]. See <<Using Service Catalog with `odo`,using service catalog>> section for more details.
====

* If you do not use Minishift, `odo` automatically works with any OpenShift cluster you are currently logged into. To log into the OpenShift cluster run:
+
----
$ odo login -u developer -p developer
----

. An application is an umbrella that comprises of all the components (microservices) you build. Create a component as follows:

.. Download the sample application and change directory to the location of the application:
+
----
$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex
$ cd nodejs-ex
----
.. Add a component of the type nodejs to the application:
+
----
$ odo create nodejs
----
+
NOTE: By default, the latest image is used. You can also explicitly supply an image version by using `odo create openshift/nodejs:8`.
.. Push the initial source code to the component:
+
----
$ odo push
----
+
Your component is now deployed to OpenShift.
. Create a URL and add an entry in the local configuration file as follows:
+
----
$ odo url create --port 8080
----
+
. Push the changes. This creates a URL on the cluster.
+
----
$ odo push
----
+
. List the URLs to check the desired URL for the component.
+
----
$ odo url list
----
+
. View your deployed application using the generated URL.
+
----
$ curl <URL>
----
+
.  Edit your code and push the changes to the component:
..  Edit one of the layout files within the Node.js directory.
+
----
$ vim views/index.html
----
..  Push the changes:
+
----
$ odo push
----
..  Refresh your application in the browser to see the changes.

After each change, you can update your component using: `odo push`.

== Other key `odo` features

=== Adding storage to the component

`odo` enables you to persist data between restarts by making it easy to add storage to your component as follows:

----
$ odo storage create nodestorage --path=/opt/app-root/src/storage/ --size=1Gi
----

This adds storage to your component with an allocated size of 1 Gb.

=== Using command completion

[NOTE]
====
* Currently command completion is only supported for bash, zsh and fish shells.
* If you either rename the `odo` executable or move it, the
completion system stops working and you will need to re-enable it
accordingly.
====

`odo` provides smart completion of command parameters based on user input. For this to work, `odo` needs to integrate with the executing shell.

* To install command completion automatically, run `odo --complete` and press `y` when asked to install the completion hook.
* To install the completion hook manually add
`complete -o nospace -C <full path to your odo binary> odo` to your shell configuration file (e.g. `.bashrc` for `bash`).
* To disable completion, run `odo --uncomplete`.

After any modification to your shell configuration file, you will need to `source` it or restart your shell.

=== Using the `.odoignore` and `.gitignore` files

The `.odoignore` file in the root directory of your application is used to ignore a list of files/patterns. This applies to both `odo push` and `odo watch`.

If the `.odoignore` file does _not_ exist, the `.gitignore` file is used instead for ignoring specific files and folders.

For example, to ignore `.git` files, any files with the `.js` extension, and the folder `tests`, add the following to either the `.odoignore` or the `.gitignore` file:

[source,bash]
----
.git
*.js
/tests
----

The `.odoignore` file allows any link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)[glob expressions] to be used, for example you can use the following:

[source,bash]
----
/openshift/**/*.json
----

=== Using Service Catalog with `odo`

If you use Minishift, you require version 1.22 or above.

In order to use the Service Catalog it must be enabled within your OpenShift cluster.

. Start an OpenShift cluster, version 3.10 and above.
. Enable the Service Catalog:
+
----
$ MINISHIFT_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL=y minishift start --extra-clusterup-flags "--enable=*,service-catalog,automation-service-broker"
----

. After you enable or start `minishift` use:

* `odo catalog list services` to list the services
* `odo service <verb> <servicename>` to list service catalog related operations

=== Adding a custom builder

OpenShift enables you to add a link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.7/creating_images/custom.html[custom image] to bridge the gap between the creation of custom images. A custom builder image usually includes the base image of link:https://hub.docker.com/r/openshift/origin-custom-docker-builder/[openshift/origin-custom-docker-builder].

The following example demonstrates the successful import and use of the link:registry.access.redhat.com/redhat-openjdk-18/openjdk18-openshift[redhat-openjdk-18] image:

.Prerequisites:
`oc` binary is link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html#installing-the-cli[installed] and present on the `$PATH`.

.Procedure:

. Import the image into OpenShift:
+
----
$ oc import-image openjdk18 --from=registry.access.redhat.com/redhat-openjdk-18/openjdk18-openshift --confirm
----
. Tag the image to make it accessible to `odo`:
+
----
$ oc annotate istag/openjdk18:latest tags=builder
----
. Deploy it with `odo`:
+
----
$ odo create openjdk18 --git https://github.com/openshift-evangelists/Wild-West-Backend
----
