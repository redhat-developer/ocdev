= Completion architecture

`odo` provides smart completion of command names, arguments and flags when typing commands. The completion architecture allows for completion handlers (i.e. pieces of code that provide the suggestions to the shell running the command) to be written entirely in go. This document describes the architecture, how to develop new completion handlers and
how to activate/deactivate completions for `odo`.

== Architecture

The completion architecture relies on the https://github.com/posener/complete[`posener/complete`] project.
`posener/complete` relies on providing implementations of their `Predictor` interface:

[source,go]
----
type Predictor interface {
    Predict(Args) []string
}
----

These implementations are then bound to a `complete.Command` which describes how commands are supposed to be completed by the shell. While
it is possible to create an external application simply for the purpose of providing completions, it made more sense to have `odo` itself deal with exposing possible completions. In this case, we need to hook into the `cobra` command lifecycle and expose completion information before `cobra` takes over. This happens in the main entry point for the `odo` application. Completion information is provided by the `createCompletion` function which walks the `cobra` command tree and creates the `complete.Command` tree as it goes along, attaching completion handler to commands (for arguments) and flags.

In order to provide this information, `odo` allows commands to register completion handlers for their arguments and flags using `completion.RegisterCommandHandler` and
`completion.RegisterCommandFlagHandler` respectively. These functions will adapt the contextualized predictor that we expose to commands to the `posener/complete` `Predictor` interface internally.

== Create a new completion handler

Let’s take the example of the `odo service delete` command. The command expects a service name as an argument. In order to provide automatic completion, the command will register a completion handler as follows:

== Create a `completion.ContextualizedPredictor` implementation

`completion.ContextualizedPredictor` is defined as
`type ContextualizedPredictor func(cmd *cobra.Command, args parsedArgs, context *genericclioptions.Context) []string`
which is a function which should return an array of possible completion strings based on the given arguments.

This function should be put in `pkg/odo/util/completion/completionhandlers.go` so that it could be reused across commands.

While filtering is done by `posener/complete` itself, automatically removing all completions not prefixed by what you’ve typed already, it might be useful to use the values provided by `parsedArgs` to help optimize things to avoid repeating possible completions for example.

== Register the completion handler

The command should register the appropriate completion handler using `completion.RegisterCommandHandler(command *cobra.Command, predictor ContextualizedPredictor)` in the case of an argument completion handler or using `completion.RegisterCommandFlagHandler(command *cobra.Command, flag string, predictor ContextualizedPredictor)`
in the case of a flag completion handler. Registering the completion handler will make it available for `main.createCompletion` which will then automatically create the completion information from it.
