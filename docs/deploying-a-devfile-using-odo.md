# Introduction to devfile

What is a devfile?

A [devfile](https://redhat-developer.github.io/devfile/) is a portable file that describes your development environment. It allows reproducing a *portable* developmental environment without the need of reconfiguration.

With a devfile you can describe:

  - Development components such as container definition for build and application runtimes

  - A list of pre-defined commands that can be run

  - Projects to initially clone

odo takes this devfile and transforms it into a workspace of multiple containers running on Kubernetes or OpenShift.

Devfiles are YAML files with a defined [schema](https://devfile.github.io/devfile/_attachments/api-reference.html).

# odo and devfile

odo can now create components from devfiles as recorded in registries. odo automatically consults the [default registry](https://github.com/odo-devfiles/registry) but users can also add their own registries. Devfiles contribute new component types that users can pull to begin development immediately.

An example deployment scenario:

1.  `odo create` will consult the recorded devfile registries to offer the user a selection of available component types and pull down the associated `devfile.yaml` file

2.  `odo push` parses and then deploys the component in the following order:
    
    1.  Parses and validates the YAML file
    
    2.  Deploys the development environment to your Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster
    
    3.  Synchronizes your source code to the containers
    
    4.  Executes any prerequisite commands

# Deploying your first devfile

## Prerequisites for a Kubernetes Cluster

  - Before proceeding, you must know your ingress domain name or ingress IP to specify `--host` for `odo url create`.
    
    Ingress IP is usually the external IP of ingress controller service. For example, for Minikube running in a virtual machine you can get it by `minikube ip`. Checkout this [document](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) to know more about ingress.

## Prerequisites for an OpenShift Cluster

  - Create a project to keep your source code, tests, and libraries organized in a separate single unit.

  - You must also know your ingress domain name or ingress IP to specify `--host` for `odo url create`. This can be found using `crc ip`.
    
    Ingress IP is usually the external IP of ingress controller service. For example, for [CodeReady Containers](https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-containers/overview) running in a virtual machine you can get it by `crc ip`. Checkout this [document](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) to know more about ingress.
    
    1.  Log in to an OpenShift cluster:
        
        ``` sh
          $ odo login -u developer -p developer
        ```
    
    2.  Create a project:
        
        ``` sh
          $ odo project create myproject
           ✓  Project 'myproject' is ready for use
           ✓  New project created and now using project : myproject
        ```

# Listing all available devfile components

  - Before deploying your first component, have a look at what is available:
    
    ``` sh
      $ odo catalog list components
      Odo Devfile Components:

In our example, we will be using `java-springboot` to deploy a sample [Springboot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) component.

# Deploying a Java Spring Boot® component to a Kubernetes / OpenShift cluster

In this example we will be deploying an [example Spring Boot® component](https://github.com/odo-devfiles/springboot-ex) that uses [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) and Java 8 JDK.

1.  Download the example Spring Boot® component.
    
    ``` sh
     $ git clone https://github.com/odo-devfiles/springboot-ex
    ```
    
    Alternatively, you can pass in `--starter` to `odo create` to have odo download a project specified in the devfile.

2.  Change the current directory to the component directory:
    
    ``` sh
     $ cd <directory-name>
    ```

3.  Create a component configuration using the `java-springboot` component-type named `myspring`:
    
    ``` sh
       $ odo create java-springboot myspring
    
       Validation
        ✓  Checking devfile compatibility [195728ns]
        ✓  Creating a devfile component from registry: DefaultDevfileRegistry [170275ns]
        ✓  Validating devfile component [281940ns]
    
        Please use odo push command to create the component with source deployed
    ```

4.  List the contents of the directory to see the devfile and sample Java application source code:
    
    ``` sh
      $ ls
      README.md devfile.yaml    pom.xml     src
    ```

5.  Create a URL in order to access the deployed component:
    
    > **Note**
    > 
    > If deploying on OpenShift, you can skip this step and a Route will be created for you automatically. On Kubernetes, you need to pass ingress domain name via `--host` flag.
    
    ``` sh
     $ odo url create  --host example.com
      ✓  URL myspring-8080.example.com created for component: myspring
    
     To apply the URL configuration changes, please use odo push
    ```

6.  Push the component to the cluster:
    
    ``` sh
      $ odo push
    
      Validation
       ✓  Validating the devfile [81808ns]

       ✓  Changes successfully pushed to component
    ```

7.  List the URLs of the component:
    
    ``` sh
     $ odo url list
     Found the following URLs for component myspring
     NAME              URL                                       PORT     SECURE
     myspring-8080     http://myspring-8080.example.com     8080     false
    ```

8.  View your deployed application using the generated URL:
    
    ``` sh
      $ curl http://myspring-8080.example.com

1.  Download the example Node.js® component
    
    ``` sh
     $ git clone https://github.com/odo-devfiles/nodejs-ex
    ```

2.  Change the current directory to the component directory:
    
    ``` sh
     $ cd <directory-name>
    ```

3.  List the contents of the directory to confirm that the application is indeed a Node.js® application:
    
    ``` sh
     $ ls
     LICENSE  package.json  package-lock.json  README.md  server.js  test
    ```

# Deploying a Quarkus Application to a Kubernetes / OpenShift cluster

In this example we will be deploying a [Quarkus component](https://github.com/odo-devfiles/quarkus-ex) that uses GraalVM and JDK1.8+.

1.  Download the example Quarkus component
    
    ``` sh
     $ git clone https://github.com/odo-devfiles/quarkus-ex && cd quarkus-ex
    ```

2.  Create a Quarkus odo component

        ✓  Validating devfile component [281940ns]
    
        Please use odo push command to create the component with source deployed
    ```

3.  Create a URL in order to access the deployed component:
    
    > **Note**
    > 
    > If deploying on OpenShift, you can skip this step and a Route will be created for you automatically. On Kubernetes, you need to pass ingress domain name via `--host` flag.
    
    ``` sh
     $ odo url create  --host example.com
      ✓  URL myquarkus-8080.example.com created for component: myquarkus
    
     To apply the URL configuration changes, please use odo push
    ```

4.  Push the component to the cluster:
    
    ``` sh
      $ odo push
    
    Validation
     ✓  Validating the devfile [44008ns]
    
    Creating Kubernetes resources for component myquarkus

You can now continue developing your application. Just run `odo push` and refresh your browser to view the latest changes.

You can also run `odo watch` to watch changes in the source code. Just refreshing the browser will render the source code changes.

Run `odo delete` to delete the application from cluster.

1.  To delete your deployed application:
