# Development Guide

## Workflow

### Fork the main repository

1. Go to https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo
2. Click the "Fork" button (at the top right)

### Clone your fork

The commands below require that you have $GOPATH. We highly recommended you put odo code into your $GOPATH.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/$YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/odo.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/redhat-developer/odo
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/redhat-developer/odo
git remote add upstream 'https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo'
```

### Create a branch and make changes

```sh
git checkout -b myfeature
# Make your code changes
```

### Keeping your development fork in sync

```sh
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master
```

**Note for maintainers**: If you have write access to the main repository at github.com/redhat-developer/odo, you should modify your git configuration so that you can't accidentally push to upstream:

```sh
git remote set-url --push upstream no_push
```

### Pushing changes to your fork

```sh
git commit
git push -f origin myfeature
```

### Creating a pull request

1. Visit https://github.com/$YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/odo.git
2. Click the "Compare and pull request" button next to your "myfeature" branch.
3. Check out the pull request process for more details

**Pull request description:** A PR should contain an accurate description of the feature being implemented as well as a link to an active issue (if any).

### Test Driven Development

We follow Test Driven Development(TDD) workflow in our development process. You can read more about it [here](/docs/tdd-workflow.md).

## Dependency Management

odo uses `glide` to manage dependencies.

They are not strictly required for building odo but they are required when managing dependencies under the `vendor/` directory.

If you want to make changes to dependencies please make sure that `glide` is installed and are in your `$PATH`.

### Installing glide

Get `glide`:

```sh
go get -u github.com/Masterminds/glide
```

Check that `glide` is working

```sh
glide --version
```

### Using glide to add a new dependency

#### Adding new dependency

1. Update `glide.yaml` file. Add new packages or subpackages to `glide.yaml` depending if you added whole new package as dependency or just new subpackage.

2. Run `glide update --strip-vendor` to get new dependencies

3. Commit updated `glide.yaml`, `glide.lock` and `vendor` to git.


#### Updating dependencies

1. Set new package version in  `glide.yaml` file.

2. Run `glide update --strip-vendor` to update dependencies

# Release guide

## Making a release

Making artifacts for new release is automated. 
When new git tag is created, Travis-ci deploy job automatically builds binaries and uploads it to GitHub release page.

1. Create PR with updated version in following files:
    - [cmd/version.go](/cmd/version.go)
    - [scripts/install.sh](/scripts/install.sh)
    - [README.md](/README.md)
    - [odo.rb](https://github.com/kadel/homebrew-odo/blob/master/Formula/odo.rb) in [kadel/homebrew-odo](https://github.com/kadel/homebrew-odo)

    There is a helper script [scripts/bump-version.sh](/scripts/bump-version.sh) that should change version number in all files listed above (expect odo.rb).

    To update the CLI Structure in README.md, run `make generate-cli-structure` and update the section in [README.md](/README.md#cli-structure)

    To update the CLI reference documentation in docs/cli-reference.md, run `make generate-cli-structure > docs/cli-reference.md`.
2. When PR is merged create and push new git tag for version.
    ```
    git tag v0.0.1
    git push upstream v0.0.1
    ```
    Or create new release using GitHub site (this has to be a proper release, not just draft). 
    Do not upload any binaries for release
    When new tag is created Travis-CI starts a special deploy job.
    This job builds binaries automatically (via `make prepare-release`) and then uploads it to GitHub release page (done using odo-bot user).
3. When a job finishes you should see binaries on the GitHub release page. Release is now marked as a draft. Update descriptions and publish release.
4. Verify that packages have been uploaded to rpm and deb repositories.
5. Confirm the binaries are available in GitHub release page and update the file `build/VERSION` with latest version number.

## odo-bot
This is GitHub user that does all the automation.

### Scripts using odo-bot
