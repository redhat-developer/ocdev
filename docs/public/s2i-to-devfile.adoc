== Migrating from S2I (Source-to-Image) components to Devfile components

https://devfile.github.io/[Devfiles] are new way of deploying component with odo.

Existing users using S2I based components can migrate to a devfile component by following the below steps:

. Change to the component directory you want to migrate:
+
[source,sh]
----
 $ cd <directory-name>
----

. List the component status 
+
[source,sh]
----
 $ odo list

Openshift Components: 
APP     NAME      PROJECT        TYPE       SOURCETYPE     STATE
app     myapp     myproject      nodejs     local          Pushed

----

. Convert the S2I component to a devfile component by running the following command:
+
[source,sh]
----
 $ odo utils convert-to-devfile
 
 devfile.yaml is available in the current directory.

----

. Push the newly generated devfile component:
+
[source,sh]
----
 $ odo push 
 
 Validation
  ✓  Validating the devfile [40136ns]

 Creating Kubernetes resources for component myapp
  ✓  Waiting for component to start [12s]

  ✓  URL myapp-8080: http://myapp-8080-example.com/ created

 Syncing to component myapp
  ✓  Checking files for pushing [499419ns]
  ✓  Syncing files to the component [155ms]

 Executing devfile commands for component myapp
  ✓  Executing s2i-assemble command "/opt/odo/bin/s2i-setup && /opt/odo/bin/assemble-and-restart" [47s]
  ✓  Executing s2i-run command "/opt/odo/bin/run" [1s]

 Pushing devfile component myapp
  ✓  Changes successfully pushed to component

----

. Check the component status, there should be two components running both S2I and devfile:
+
[source,sh]
----
 $ odo list 
 
 Devfile Components: 
 APP     NAME      PROJECT        TYPE      STATE
 app     myapp     myproject      myapp     Pushed

 Openshift Components: 
 APP     NAME      PROJECT        TYPE       SOURCETYPE     STATE
 app     myapp     myproject      nodejs     local          Pushed
----

. Delete the unused S2I component:

+
[source,sh]
----
 $ odo delete --s2i --all --force
 ✓  Deleting component myapp [277ms]
 ✓  Component myapp from application app has been deleted
 ✓  Config for the Component myapp has been deleted
