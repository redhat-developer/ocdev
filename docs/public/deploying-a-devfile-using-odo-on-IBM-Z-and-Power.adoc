== Using odo on IBM-Z and Power
=== Introduction to devfile

What is a devfile?

A https://redhat-developer.github.io/devfile/[devfile] is a portable file that describes your development environment. It allows reproducing a _portable_ development environment without the need of reconfiguration.

With a devfile you can describe:

* Development components such as container definition for build and application runtimes
* A list of pre-defined commands that can be run
* Projects to initially clone

odo takes this devfile and uses it to create a workspace of multiple containers running on Kubernetes or OpenShift.

Devfiles are YAML files with a defined https://devfile.github.io/devfile/_attachments/api-reference.html[schema].

=== odo and devfile

odo can now create components from devfiles as recorded in registries. odo automatically consults the https://github.com/odo-devfiles/registry[default registry] but users can also add their own registries. Devfiles contribute new component types that users can pull to begin development immediately.

An example deployment scenario:

. `odo create` will consult the recorded devfile registries to offer the user a selection of available component types and pull down the associated `devfile.yaml` file
. `odo push` parses and then deploys the component in the following order:
 .. Parses and validates the YAML file
 .. Deploys the development environment to your Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster
 .. Synchronizes your source code to the containers
 .. Executes any prerequisite commands

=== Deploying your first devfile on IBM Z & Power
Since the DefaultDevfileRegistry doesn't support IBM Z & Power now, you will need to create a secure private DevfileRegistry first. To create a new secure private DevfileRegistry , please check the doc link:https://github.com/openshift/odo/blob/main/docs/public/secure-registry.adoc[secure registry].

The images can be used for devfiles on IBM Z & Power
