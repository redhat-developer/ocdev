# Using devfile lifecycle events

`odo` uses devfiles to build and deploy components. You can also use devfile events with a component during it's lifecycle. The four different types of devfile events are `preStart`, `postStart`, `preStop` and `postStop`

Each event is an array of devfile commands to be executed. The devfile command to be executed should be of type `exec` or `composite`:

```yaml
components:
  - container:
      name: runtime
      image: quay.io/eclipse/che-nodejs10-ubi:nightly
      memoryLimit: 1024Mi
      endpoints:
        - name: "3000/tcp"
          targetPort: 3000 
      mountSources: true
      command: ['tail']
      args: [ '-f', '/dev/null']
  - container:
      name: "tools"
      image: quay.io/eclipse/che-nodejs10-ubi:nightly
      mountSources: true
      memoryLimit: 1024Mi
commands:
  - exec:
      id: copy
      commandLine: "cp /tools/myfile.txt tools.txt"
      component: tools
      workingDir: /
  - exec:
      id: initCache
      commandLine: "./init_cache.sh"
      component: tools
      workingDir: /
  - exec:
      id: connectDB
      commandLine: "./connect_db.sh"
      component: runtime
      workingDir: /
  - exec:
      id: disconnectDB
      commandLine: "./disconnect_db.sh"
      component: runtime
      workingDir: /
  - exec:
      id: cleanup
      commandLine: "./cleanup.sh"
      component: tools
      workingDir: /
  - composite:
      id: postStartCompositeCmd
      label: Copy and Init Cache
      commands:
        - copy
        - initCache
      parallel: true
events:
  preStart:
    - "connectDB"
  postStart:
    - "postStartCompositeCmd" 
  preStop:
    - "disconnectDB"
  postStop:
    - "cleanup"
```

### preStart

PreStart events are executed as init containers for the project pod in the order they are specified. The devfile command's `commandLine` and `workingDir` become the init container's command and as a result the devfile component container's `command` and `args` or the container image's `Command` and `Args` are overwritten. If a composite command with `parallel: true` is used, it will be executed sequentially as Kubernetes init containers only execute in sequence.

In the above example, PreStart is going to execute the devfile command `connectDB` as an init container for the odo component's main pod.

Caution should be exercised when using preStart with devfile container component that mount sources. File operations with preStart on the project sync directory may result in inconsistent behaviour.

### postStart

PostStart events are executed when the Kubernetes deployment for the odo component is created. 

In the above example, PostStart is going to execute the composite command `postStartCompositeCmd` once the odo component's deployment is created and the pod is up and running. The composite command `postStartCompositeCmd`'s sub-command `copy` and `initCache` are going to be executed in parallel.

### preStop

PreStop events are executed before the Kubernetes deployment for the odo component is deleted. 

In the above example, PreStop is going to execute the devfile command `disconnectDB` before the odo component deployment is deleted.
