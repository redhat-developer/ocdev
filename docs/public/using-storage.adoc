# Storage commands

`odo` lets users manage storage in the cluster. A storage is a https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#persistentvolumeclaim[PVC], which is a way for users to "claim" durable storage (such as a GCE PersistentDisk or an iSCSI volume) without knowing the details of the particular cloud environment.

# Adding a storage

We can add a storage to the cluster using `odo storage create`

```
odo storage create store --path /data --size 1Gi
 âœ“  Added storage store to nodejs-project-ufyy

Please use `odo push` command to make the storage accessible to the component
```
The storage in the above example has been mounted to the `/data` path and has a size of `1Gi`

# Listing storage

We can check the storage currently used by the component using `odo storage list`

```
odo storage list
The component 'nodejs-project-ufyy' has the following storage attached:
NAME      SIZE     PATH      STATE
store     1Gi      /data     Not Pushed
```

# Deleting a storage

We can delete a storage using `odo storage delete`

```
odo storage delete store -f
Deleted storage store from nodejs-project-ufyy

Please use `odo push` command to delete the storage from the cluster
```
