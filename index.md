title: odo 
description: "odo is a fast, iterative, and straightforward CLI tool for developers who write, build, and deploy applications on Kubernetes and OpenShift.<br><br>Existing tools such as kubectl and oc are more operations-focused and require a deep-understanding of Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts. odo abstracts away complex Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts for the developer."
