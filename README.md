# OpenShift Do - Developer Focused CLI for OpenShift

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/openshift/odo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/openshift/odo) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/openshift/odo/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/openshift/odo) [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/openshift/odo/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/openshift/odo/tree/master) [![mattermost](/docs/img/mattermost.svg)](https://chat.openshift.io/developers/channels/odo)

OpenShift Do (odo) is a fast, iterative, and opinionated CLI tool for developers who write, build, and deploy applications on OpenShift.

Existing tools such as `oc` are more operations-focused and require a deep-understanding of Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts. OpenShift Do abstracts away complex Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts, thus allowing developers to focus on what's most important to them: code.

## Key features
OpenShift Do is designed to be simple and concise with the following key features:

- Simple syntax and design centered around concepts familiar to developers, such as project, application, and component.
- Completely client based. No server is required within the OpenShift cluster for deployment.
- Supports multiple languages and frameworks such as Node.js, Java, Ruby, Perl, PHP, and Python.
- Detects changes to local code and deploys it to the cluster automatically, giving instant feedback to validate changes in real-time.
- Lists all available components and services from the OpenShift cluster.

## Installation

**Prerequisites:**
* OpenShift 3.10.0 and above is required.
* We recommend using [Minishift](https://github.com/minishift/minishift).

In order to correctly use OpenShift Do you must download it and add it to your PATH environment variable:

1. Download the `odo-windows-amd64.exe.gz` file from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/openshift/odo/releases).
2. Extract the file.
3. Add the location of extracted binary to your PATH environment variable by following [this Wiki page](https://github.com/openshift/odo/wiki/Setting-PATH-variable-on-Windows).

## Deploying an application using OpenShift Do

After installing OpenShift Do, follow these steps to build, push, and deploy a Node.js application. Examples for other supported languages and runtimes can be found [here](https://github.com/openshift/odo/blob/master/docs/examples.md).

1. Start a local OpenShift development cluster by running minishift.
```sh
$ minishift start
```

2. Log into the OpenShift cluster.
```sh
$ odo login -u developer -p developer
```

3. Create an application. An application in OpenShift Do is an umbrella under which you add other components.
```sh
$ odo app create node-example-app
```

4. Download the Node.js sample code and change directory to the location of the sample code.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex
$ cd nodejs-ex
```

5. Add a component of type `nodejs` to your application.
```sh
$ odo create nodejs
```
6. Deploy your application.
```sh
$ odo push
```
7. Create a URL to access the application and visit it to test it.
```sh
$ odo url create
$ curl nodejs-myproject.192.168.42.147.nip.io
```

For more in-depth information and advanced use-cases such as adding storage to a component or linking components, see the [interactive tutorial](https://learn.openshift.com/introduction/developing-with-odo/) or the [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started.md).

## Glossary

**Application:** An application consists of multiple microservices or components that work individually to build the entire application.

**Component:** A component is similar to a microservice. Multiple components make up an application. A component has different attributes like storage. OpenShift Do supports multiple component types like nodejs, perl, php, python and ruby.

**Service:** Typically a service is a database or a service that a component links to or depends on. For example: MariaDB, Jenkins, MySQL. This comes from the OpenShift "Service Catalog" and must be enabled within your cluster.
