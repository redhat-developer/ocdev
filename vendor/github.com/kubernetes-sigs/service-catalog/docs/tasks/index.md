This section contains pages that show how to do individual tasks. A task page
shows how to do a single thing, typically given by a short sequence of steps.

## [Install a Broker](./install_broker.md)

You must register a broker with Service Catalog to make the services that broker
offers available on your cluster.

## [Synchronize a Broker](./sync_broker.md)

When a broker's catalog changes, it may need to be resynchronized with Service Catalog.

## [Remove a Stuck Instance or Binding](./stuck_instance.md)

When a broker stops responding, a user may be unable to delete instances and
bindings belonging to that broker. In such cases, the user may need to
forcefully remove such 'stuck' instances or bindings.
